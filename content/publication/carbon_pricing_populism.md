title: "Opposition to carbon pricing and right-wing populism"
subtitle: "Ontarioâ€™s 2018 general election"
summary: "We analyze a survey of Ontario voters to explain the victory of the right-wing populist Ontario Progressive Conservatives under Doug Ford. We test whether or not opposition to the previous government's carbon pricing plan was a significant reason for motivating support for the Progressive Conservatives. We find that it was a marginally significant factor. "
